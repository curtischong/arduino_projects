#### aka teaching my sister how to code

Like all responsible brothers, I've put off finding my sister a christmas present until the last week... yikes!
So I went straight to Amazon, redeemed my Amazon Prime student membership and bought an arduino starter kit for a pretty good price (like all responsible brothers do)

### Arduino Tank

Anyhow, she wanted to use it as part of a school project so I stuck by her for a few hours and here's the result!

After several iterations, she got a joystick to control a stepper motor and have it fire when the joystick is pressed.

(tbh this repo is here just for archival purposes so my sister can read this 30 years from now :) )
